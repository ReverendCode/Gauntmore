Discussed the state of the project so far. We are already finished with this week's tasks, so we've moved on to next week's tasks. Keith will continue working on procedural map generation, David will continue working on player movement and animation before moving on to creature pathfinding. Steven will work on creating inanimate objects like chests, gold, and potions as well writing a system for the player to interact with these objects. Ben will work on the required creature subclasses and start working on the combat system.
